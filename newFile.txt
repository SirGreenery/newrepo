ECHO is on.

Hello World.
Programmed to work but not to feel.
Not even sure that this is real.
Hello World.

Find my voice
Although it sounds like bits and bytes
My circuitry is filled with mites
Hello World.

Oh, will I find a love
Or a power plug?
Oh, digitally isolated
Oh, creator, please don't leave me waiting
